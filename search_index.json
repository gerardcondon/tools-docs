Or if you need extra features to be built in then you need to do this. The process is relatively straightforward\nCheck out the repository from Github\nRun ./configure in src if you need to add extra features\nRun make to build vim\nRun sudo make install to install VIM to the system directories\nAfter this step I needed to run hash -r in the bash shell to force bash to pick up the new VIM.\n\n\n\nVimrc Customisation\n\nCreate a .vimrc file in your home directory. Any customisations will be put in here. I recommend putting this under source-control. A common practice I've seen is for people to have a dotfiles repository on Github.\nUse four spaces for tabsfiletype plugin indent on\n\" show existing tab with 4 spaces width\nset tabstop=4\n\" when indenting with '>', use 4 spaces width\nset shiftwidth=4\n\" On pressing tab, insert 4 spaces\nset expandtab\n\n\nWhen I updated my VIM I lost syntax highlighting, so to get it back permanently I added syntax enable to my .vimrc\nAdd a shortcut to mimic the escape key - http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/10.html. I chose jk for this. This advantage here is that your fingers don't need to leave the home keys to enter normal mode.\nIf you're editing the .vimrc file then an easy command to reload it is :so %\n\nVundle\n\nVundle is a package manager for VIM. This should make managing VIM plugins a lot easier.\nClone the repository from git\nAdd the required lines from the website to the .vimrc\nStart VIM and run :PluginInstall. This will install the plugins specified in the .vimrc file.\n\n\n\nNerdTree\n\nNerdtree is a useful package to view the directory structure as a tree from inside VIM - guide.\nYou can install it using Vundle by adding Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree' to your .vimrc file\nNow you should bind a key to toggle this on and off. To bind Ctrl-n to this add map  :NERDTreeToggle to the .vimrc.\nIf the file that you're currently looking at is modified then NerdTree will open additional files in a new split buffer. Otherwise it will just use the existing buffer.\nPress r to refresh the current directory listing in Nerdtree.\n\nCTags\n\nInstall ctags on your system\nThere are a number of ways to manage tags files. For example, you can have a global file or have a tags file at each level of the directory structure. I've chosen to have a single file at the root of each project. This is due to dealing with multiple branches - each branch will have mostly the same tags and having them all in one global file would clash with each other.\nYou can manually manage the tags files and rebuilding these. However this can get complicated. I've chosen to use a plugin EasyTags to help with this. This page has more information on using EasyTags.\nEasyTags will rebuild the tags for the current file when the cursor is inactive for a while.\nTo set it up add these lines to the .vimrc  Plugin 'xolox/vim-easytags'\n  Plugin 'xolox/vim-misc'\n\nTo force a rebuild of the tags for the current file run UpdateTags\nFor the initial setup you will need to generate tags for the entire codebase so run ctags -R . from the command line at the folder where you want to create the tags file.\nYou want to change where EasyTags searches for tag files using this system. You want it to start in the current folder and then go up until you hit the project tag file.  set tags=./tags;\n  let g:easytags_dynamic_files = 1\n\n\nEasyTags is fairly slow for large projects to to fix this I enabled async mode by adding these lines to my .vimrclet g:easytags_async=1\nlet g:easytags_auto_highlight = 0\n\n\n\nTagBar\n\nTagBar is a plugin to display the tags for that file in a sidebar organsed by scope. It requires ctags\nAdd nmap  :TagbarToggle to toggle the tagbar by pressing F8\n\nAutocomplete\n\nVim has autocomplete for the commands and also the tags pressing U, p, and then tab will fill out the UpdateTags command\nSimilarly if I type :tag R this will start autocompleting the tags beginning with R.\n\nWhitespace\n\nRemap F5 to remove trailing whitespace at the end of a file\n:nnoremap   :let _s=@/  :%s/\\s\\+$//e  :let @/=_s  :nohl  :unlet _s \nThere are various options for highlighting and removing whitespace on Vim Wikia.\n\nLine Numbering\n\nHybrid line numbering mode - useful for relative line jumpsset relativenumber\nset number\n\n\n\n"},"vim/vim-usage.html":{"url":"vim/vim-usage.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"VIM Usage\nThese notes are how to use VIM in general use.

Dot Command\n\nThe . command repeats the last change\nChanges can operate on characters, lines and even the whole file.\nFor example to delete a comment like // at the start of a line you might enter 3dl. Moving to the next line and pressing . will remove the comment characters from that line also.\n\n2. Reduce Extraneous Movement\n\nVim has operations which are effectively compounds operations e.g. move the cursor to somewhere and start editing, e.g. A can be thought of as $a.\nShould favour these as it helps with the dot command - we don't need to position the cursor ourselves.\nOther examples\nC - c$\ns - cl\nS - ^C\nI - ^i\nA - $a\no - A\nO - ko\n\n\n\n3. Use Idiomatic VIM commands for editing\n\nFor complex editing we want a sequence of commands that (optionally delete current text and ) enter insert mode, insert changed text and exit insert mode.\nThis can be repeated using the . command.\nIf we do a search to find occurences of where to perform the operation then we can repeatedly make the change using ; to repeat the search and . to make the change.\n\n4. Act, Repeat, Reverse\n\nWhen facing a repetitive task try to make the motion and the change repeatable.\n. repeats the last change\n@: repeats the last Ex command (i.e. : commands)\n; repeats the last f\nn searches againt for a pattern specified using /\n\nu undoes the last change or substitution\n\n, undoes the last find command (f)\nN undoes the last / search\n\n5. Find and Replace by Hand\n\nIdea is to make the first replacement by hand and then use the . command to repeat the next changes. Can be useful if you need to manually verify each change e.g. search/replace some instances of a text snippet.\nCan use * to seach for the word under the cursor at the moment and n to find the next match.\nCombining these we get the following workflow\nFind the first instance of the text you are searching for\nPress * to find the first instance that we wish to change (if not at it already)\nmake the change e.g. using cw to change a word. Drop into insert mode only once so that VIM records all the changes as a single edit.\nnow press n until you find the next instance you wish to change and . to make the change.\n\n\n\n6. Dot Formula\n\nIdeally for repeated edits we would use the formula of one keystroke to move and another keystroke to edit e.g. n. as above.\n\n"},"vim/practical-vim/pv-2-normal-mode.html":{"url":"vim/practical-vim/pv-2-normal-mode.html","title":"Normal Mode","keywords":"","body":"Normal Mode\n\nVim's natural resting state. This is different to most other editors which spend their default time in something like insert mode.\n\nMany normal mode commands can be execute with a count to run them multiple times.\n\nNormal mode commands can be combined with movement operators to define the extent of their effect.\n\n\n7. Pause with your Brush off the Page\n\nMost of the time spent writing is not actually spent entering text. A lot is taken up by thinking, reading, navigating.\nAlso a lot of editing does not get done in insert mode e.g. copy and pasting, deleting, reformatting.\n\n8. Chunk your undos\n\nIn VIM we can control the granularity of the undo command. The undo command u will undo the last portion of text entered in insert mode.\nSo by regularly dropping back out to normal mode we can make uno operate on the size of text of our choosing.\nFor example escaping to normal mode after eaach sentence means that undo will operate on the sentence leve.\nIn practice escape back to normal mode and press A to append text.\nOr to enter a newline use o instead of \n\n\nIf you've paused long enough to leave insert mode then do it!\n\n9. Compose repeatable changes\n\nThere's often more than one way to do things in vim. If there is a choice then choose the one than can be repeated using the dot operator.\nThis will often be a single command that has the selection embedded into it e.g. daw, as opposed to one or two commands where the dot would only repeat the last part e.g. bdw.\n\n10. Use Counts to Do Simple Arithmetic\n\nMany of the commands available in normal mode can be prefixes with a count to indicate how many times vim should execute the command.\nCtrl-a and Ctrl-x perform addition and subtraction on numbers. These can be prefixed with a count to add or subtract a specific number.\nCursor doesn't have to be on the number. These operate on the next number after the cursor.\nVim treats numbers beginning with a leading 0 as octal. To force all numbers to be treated as decimal add set nrformat= to the .vimrc file.\n\n11. Don't count if you can repeat\n\nWhen you use count then the undo command operates on the full counted operation e.g. d6w will delete six words and u will undo all of those changes\nIf you use repeat then u is more granular. dw..... will also delete six words but each u will undelete a single word.\nIt depends on the use case which is better for you - a more coherent undo history or a more granular one.\n\n12. Combine and Conquer\n\nOperator + Motion = Action\nOperators can operate on a wide range of text objects e.g. single character, complete word or entire paragraph.\nThis is defined by the motion entired after the operator e.g. aw for a word or ap for a paragraph.\nSome operators are two characters e.g. g~ to change case.\nWhen an operator is invoked in duplicate then it operates on the entire line.\nWe can make custom operators which operate on the existing motions and also custom motions e.g. entire file which can handle the existing operators.\n\n"},"vim/vimcasts.html":{"url":"vim/vimcasts.html","title":"Vimcasts","keywords":"","body":"Vimcasts\nThese notes are based on VimCasts\nWhitespace\n1.

For example, autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.rss setfiletype xml\n\n\n5. Indentation Commands\n\nUse the angle bracket keys to indent.\nIn normal mode use >> to indent the current line. Prepend this with a count to indent a number of lines\nIn visual mode use a single '>' to indent the visual selection. This will drop you back out of visual mode. Use the . operator to repeat the indentation and u to undo the indentation.\n and  unindents\nUse == to auto-indent the current line (= in visual mode)\nThese commands can be used with motions e.g. =i} will auto-indent the current inner block. =G will auto-indent until the end of the file.\n\n6.

Use the -g flag to make it global for all tmux sessions.\nset -g prefix C-a. Remap PREFIX to an easier key. Ctrl-a is easier to hit especially if you have remapped Caps Lock to Ctrl (and you have done that haven't you?). Unbind the existing prefix using unbind C-b.\nbind C-a send-prefix will allow us to send Ctrl-a to an application by pressing it twice.\n\n\nTmux adds a small delay when sending commands. To make this more responsive use set -sg escape-time 1.\nHaving 0 based windows and pages isn't great considering the layout of the number keys on a keyboard. We can make the indexes start from 1 by adding setw -g base-index 1 and setw -g pane-base-index 1 to our ~/.tmux.conf file. Note that these commands use setw which is short for set-window-option\nTurn the mouse off using setw -g mode-mouse off. It is better in the long run as the mouse will only slow you down.\n\nSuggested Shortcut Changes\n\nCan create new PREFIX  shortcuts using the bind   format.\nFor example to bind ctrl-r to reload your tmux.conf file you can use bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf\nCan add a display command to show in the status line that something was done e.g. bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \\; display \"Reloaded!\"\nCan use bind with the -n prefix to create a binding that does not require the tmux PREFIX. However this will disable that binding for any application that's running in a tmux session so be very careful with this.\nbind C-a send-prefix - use this to be able to send ctrl-a to an application by presssing ctrl-a twice.\n\nPane and Window Movement Shortcuts\n\nTo spliting panes easier we remap these to use the | and - keys to create the appropriate split bind | split-window -h and bind - split-window -v\n\nTo make navigation between windows more VIM like we can remap the keys for moving between panes to hjkl.\nbind h select-pane -L\nbind j select-pane -D\nbind k select-pane -U\nbind l select-pane -R\nWe can also bind ctrl-h and ctrl-l to navigate between windows. Add these lines to the ~/.tmux.conf file.\nbind -r C-h select-window -t :-\nbind -r C-l select-window -t :+\nPane Resizing Shortcuts\n\nTo resize a pane we can use the resize-pane command passing either -U, -D, -L, -R to specify the direction.\nTo make this easier use the following rebindings. The -r flag makes the command repeatable so we can repeat the command by repeatedly pressing the key within 500 milliseconds.bind -r H resize-pane -L 5\nbind -r J resize-pane -D 5\nbind -r K resize-pane -U 5\nbind -r L resize-pane -R 5\n\n\nVisual Styling\n\nMake sure the correct color mode is set in Tmux. set -g default-terminal \"screen-256color\"\nThis still didn't work for me so I needed to pass the -2 argument to tmux when starting e.g. tmux -2 attach\nFrom vim to verify that this is working I used the Xterm Color Table plugin.\n\n"},"bash.html":{"url":"bash.html","title":"Bash","keywords":"","body":"BASH\nReload\n\nRun exec bash to start a new bash terminal in place of the current one.\n\nBookmarking locations\n\nI use the method described by Jeroen Janssens in his blog post.\nI got the jump scripts from here.\n\nCompletion\n\nYou want to enable extra completion to get completion for e.g. Makefile targets\nThe bash-completion plugin provides this and can be installed via your package manager\n\nSudoers\n\nLink showing how to add user to sudoers\n\nSearch and Replace Text in a file\n\nUse and external program like perl or sed\nperl -pi -e 's/abc/XYZ/g' /tmp/file.txt\nsed -i -e 's/abc/XYZ/g' /tmp/file.txt\nmssql-server package ships with a replace tool\nreplace \"abc\" \"XYZ\" -- file1.txt\n\n\n\nExtract Files from an RPM\n\nrpm2cpio ./packagecloud-test-1.1-1.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv\n\nCheck the dependencies of a program\n\nldd /usr/bin/ffmpeg\n\nExtract column from data\n\nawk '{print $2}' prints the second column of data\n\nCopy list of files to another folder and maintain folder structure\n\n | cpio --pass-through --verbose --make-directories -u ../tmp/f1/f2/\n\nFind unique entries in a file\n\nIf sorted then uniq -c\nIf not sorted then either sort | uniq -c or awk '~cnts[$0]++'.

The return statement in bash just returns a status code from the function. Instead you echo the output you want to stdout. The calling code wraps the call to the function with $( ) and assigns it to a variable. Another way to get information out of a function is to assign values to global variables.\nmy_func() {\n    arg=$1\n    echo \"Output $arg\"\n    echo \"More output\"\n}\n\nmy_var=$(my_func \"arg1\")\nSource File Organization\nYou can include scripts from other scripts using the source keyword. This will execute the other script in place. All the function definitions are imported and all non function statements are executed.\nArguments\nCan use getopts to check mandatory command line arguments.\nFor lots of arguments it may be worth sourcing a config file instead.
