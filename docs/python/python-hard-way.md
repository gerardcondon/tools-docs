# Learn Python the Hard Way

These are notes based on the [Learn Python the Hard Way][] book by Zed Shaw.

## Printing
* `print` prints to stdout
* can pass multiple items to be printed out - separate them by comma e.g. `print "time in secs = ", 23 * 60`

## Comments
* `#` is the comment symbol. Everything including this and after on the line is ignored.

## Arithmetic
* Standard C++ operators.
