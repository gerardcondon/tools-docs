# Vim Windows

* A window in VIM is a pane in which you view files. You can have mulitple VIM windows on screen simultaneously. They are laid out in a tiled format i.e. windows next to each other and not overlapping.
* To switch between windows use `Ctrl-w <motion-key` where motion key is one of `h`, `j`, `k` or `l`.
* `Ctrl-w Ctrl-w` will cycle between open windows.
* `Ctrl-w s` or `:sp` will create a split pane for the current buffer to give you two separate views into that buffer. Changes in one are reflected in the other immediately.
* `Ctrl-w v` or `:vsp` does the same for vertical buffers.
