# Vim modes in other editors

Other editors may have Vim modes. While they may not provide the full functionality of VIM, you can at least get the movement keys and maybe simple command mode.

## Sublime Text

* Vintage Mode
* For custom keybindings which do more than one command you need a plugin like [Chain of Command](https://github.com/jisaacks/ChainOfCommand).
